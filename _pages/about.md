I am a Professor in the Institute of Algebra and Geometry at the [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology](https://www.kit.edu) working on topology, geometric and measurable group theory, and $\ell^2$-invariants. 

Together with [Claudio Llosa Isenrich](https://www.math.kit.edu/user/llosa/index.html) and [Elia Fioravanti](https://www.eliafioravanti.com/), I run a weekly [research seminar](https://topology.math.kit.edu/english/123.php) at KIT on topology and geometric group theory. 

Since 2016, I am the speaker of the DFG-funded graduate school [RTG 2229](https://www.groups-and-spaces.kit.edu/) _Asymptotic Invariants and Limits of Groups and Spaces_, run by KIT and Heidelberg University. It aims at a systematic study of geometric spaces with regard to their asymptotic invariants and their behavior under deformations, degenerations, and taking limits.

I am also active in the DFG-funded Priority Program [SPP 2026](https://www.spp2026.de/) _Geometry at Infinity_. 

I serve on the editorial boards for [Geometry&Topology](https://msp.org/gt), [Mathematische Annalen](https://link.springer.com/journal/208), and [Manuscripta mathematica](https://link.springer.com/journal/229).
